 NODBIDIRECTEXEC   The SQL pass-through facility does not optimize the handling of SQL statements.
 DBSLICEPARM=(THREADED_APPS, 2)
                   Specifies whether SAS procedures, applications, and the DATA step can read DBMS tables in parallel, and the 
                   number of threads to use to read the DBMS tables.
 MAXSEGRATIO=75    Specifies the upper limit for the percentage of index segments that the SPD Engine identifies as containing the
